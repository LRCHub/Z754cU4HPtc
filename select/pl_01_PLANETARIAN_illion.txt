In a little over 100 years I bet
Yes every single one of us be dead and free
What's left will be a bunch of strangers
Who doesn't even exist yet
A salt and sugars in the second drawer
Just incase, dead nuclear fuels under your step
Oh, and don't forget to brush
your teeth at night
You're in range of every missile heads
in this world
Then, have you ever heard of cruel?
Have you ever heard revenge?
Have you ever heard betrayal?
I'm sorry for you to take over
Oh life is vanishing vanishing vanishing
This very moment this moment this moment
Mine is so meaningless meaningless meaningless
One comes in and one goes out
Out of this planet this planet this planet
Bye Good-bye now grandpas
and grandmas I love you
Welcome now millions and billions of aliens
Which part of life you like to start?
7billion of''me's and 'I's
Not enough to endure this crisis though
It's plenty enough hitting running and scramble
What are we gifting it to children's son?
I'm a little bit nervous left you be
in charge of my loving household
Whenever you drive make sure your seatbelts
are securely fastened
Please will you not hesitate
to show your love to whom you care
To make it all simple,
that's the very word who brought you here so
Have you ever heard of one?
Have you ever felt that one?
Have you ever yet delivered it?
To someone, I hope so
Oh life is vanishing vanishing vanishing
This very moment this moment this moment
Mine is so meaningless meaningless meaningless
One comes in and one goes out
Out of this planet this planet this planet
Bye Good-bye now grandpas
and grandmas I love you
Welcome now millions and billions of aliens
Which part of life you like to start?
